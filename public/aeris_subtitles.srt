1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
IRA DEORUM...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
The anger of the gods.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Since the beginning of time, the Earth has turned against us.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,500
When the ground splits...

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
The oceans rise...

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And the skies ignite.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Humanity has been left with only one choice: to watch in silence.

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Families torn apart.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Loved ones swallowed by chaos.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Lifetimes of memories erased in mere hours.

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,000
But this... this does not have to be our fate.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Disasters may be inevitable, but suffering is not.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,500
In the face of chaos, there is clarity.

14
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
In the storm, there is innovation.

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,500
And in humanity's darkest moments...

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,000
There is always a solution.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
AERIS.
