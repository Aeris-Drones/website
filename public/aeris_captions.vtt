00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
IRA DEORUM...

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
The anger of the gods.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Since the beginning of time, the Earth has turned against us.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
When the ground splits...

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.000
The oceans rise...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And the skies ignite.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.500
Humanity has been left with only one choice: to watch in silence.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Families torn apart.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Loved ones swallowed by chaos.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Lifetimes of memories erased in mere hours.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.000
But this... this does not have to be our fate.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Disasters may be inevitable, but suffering is not.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
In the face of chaos, there is clarity.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.500
In the storm, there is innovation.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.500
And in humanity's darkest moments...

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000
There is always a solution.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
AERIS.
